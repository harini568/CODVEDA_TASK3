 Task 3 – Basic DOM Manipulation: Counter Application
As part of my internship, I was assigned a task to build a Counter Application that demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this task is to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements dynamically, how to handle user events like button clicks, and how to update the content of a webpage without reloading it. This small project is a great introduction to how front-end applications behave in real time.

The counter application includes three primary functionalities: incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the count. Additionally, the app ensures that the count value doesn’t go below zero, maintaining logical integrity. The visual design is kept minimalistic and user-friendly using CSS, making it suitable for small-screen devices as well.

Now let’s look at the code, which is divided into three essential parts: HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (functionality).
